# Quantum.lean for Quantum computation

Hobby project to implement simulated quantum computing and targeting quantum architectures using Lean.

# Build

Using nix (with flakes enabled) and lake `nix develop --command lake build` or just `lake build` if you already have `elan`.

# Goals & ambitions


- [ ] A simple quantum simulator [presented here](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjqt10).
- [ ] Implement some basic quantum algorithms.
- [ ] Target quantum instruction set like OpenQASM.
- [ ] Prove some quantum theorems


# Contributions

Contributrions are welcome. Just try to fit inside the defined scope of the project. More details will be expanded on later.
